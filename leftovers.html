        </ul>
        <img alt="jam" class="jam" src="assets/jam.png">
        </div>
        <span style="color:#5E8967;">For overripe veggies, try:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Making soup or stew! Combine overripe veggies with stock and spices to create a hearty meal. Overripe veggies work great in stews or when pureed into soups.</li>
          <li>Pickling vegetables! Pickled onions, cucumbers, radishes, and others work well as side dishes to eat with your favorite meal. Pickling veggies also helps preserve them for longer.</li>
          <li>Making vegetable chips! You can get rid of the mushy texture of overripe veggies by drying them out in an oven to create crispy, healthy chips.
